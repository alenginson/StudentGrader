# StudentGrader
How It Works:  1. The user is asked to input their total marks.   2. The program checks if the input is valid (not less than 0 or more than 300).   3. Based on the mark range, it assigns a grade:  Above 250 → A+  201–250 → A  151–200 → B+  101–150 → B  0–100 → Failed    4. Finally, it prints the result and closes the input scanner.
